Feature Description:

1. Guests can do shipment tracking:
Without login, a user can use tracking number for package tracking, including 
associated truck id, package status, etc

2. Logged-in users can see shipment tracking history:
In addition to tracking shipments, our server keeps all the records of tracking history,
so that the next time users enter the page, they will see what tracking number they
searched before and thus provide a short path for them to check

3. Truck location map:
We implement a user-interative map to help locate and visualize the trucks status.
Users can use w,a,s,d to move the map; -,+ to scale the map. 
Users can also enter a truck id to center this specific truck.
User can even use their mouse to drag the map and move it.
We provide keyboard pressing feedback to help users interact with this map.

4. Shipment tracking map:
We implement a map to show the position of the truck which carries the package and the position of the destination to let user directly view the detailed shipment inforamtion.

5. Impressive User Interface:
We implement CSS and Javascript to display a well-designed, clean and user-friendly website.
